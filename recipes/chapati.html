        <p>This Indian dish is easier to make and only takes a few ingredients.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>140g wholemeal flour</li>
            <li>140g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of olive oil, plus extra for greasing</li>
            <li>180ml of hot water or as needed</li>
        </ul>


      <h3>Steps</h3>

       <ol>
            <li><p>In a large bowl,stir together the flours and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir in the olive oil and enough water to make a soft dough that is elastic but not sticky.</p></li>

            <li><p>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-10 mins until it is smooth. Divide into 10 pieces, or less if you want bigger breads. Roll each piece into a ball. Let them rest for a few mins.</p></li>

            <li><p></p>Heat a frying pan over medium heat until hot, and grease lightly. On a lightly floured surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the balls of the dough until very thin like a tortilla.</p></li>

            <li><p>When the pan starts smoking, put a chapati on it. Cook until the underside has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook on the other side. Put on a plate and keep warm while you cook the rest of the chapatis.</p></li>
        </ol>
